üöÄ Happy to share my latest project, **DocTalker!** This cutting-edge **VoiceBot** integrates with Streamlit to turn your PDF, DOCX, CSV, and TXT files into a dynamic conversation. Using AI, it reads, processes, and interacts with your documents, making data retrieval as easy as chatting with a friend. üó£Ô∏èüìÑ

**üîç Features:**

**Voice commands** for querying document content

**Text-to-speech** functionality for an interactive experience

Supports **multiple document** formats

**Real-time processing** and **response generation**

üí° Developed using **Python**, **Streamlit**, **PyPDF2**, **docx**, **pandas**, and several **AI models** from **OpenAI** and **Hugging Face**, this application not only enhances document accessibility but also streamlines your workflow by allowing voice-driven interactions.
